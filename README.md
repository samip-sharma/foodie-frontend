Foodie

Foodie is a Yelp inspired social media/restaurant information application. Users will instantly be connected with the fifty closest restaurants in their area, allowing them to 'like' or comment on any given restaurant, as well as search for any restaurant or restaurant type in their area. Users also have the option to 'follow' other users, to see their liked restaurants. It is built with a React frontend and Ruby on Rails backend. Data is stored on a postgreSQL database, utilizing ActiveRecord and bycrpt for secure login and persistance. Live restaurant data is pulled directly from the Yelp API and live location services are shown utilizing the Google Maps API. The application is styled with custom CSS and also employs Bootstrap.
